              In the years following a collaborative effort between J-Biotech
              and USM from 2008 to 2012, where 400 seedlings of Tridacna Gigas
              were released on Aur Island, there's been a significant gap in
              monitoring. By 2016, when these clams had reached an average size
              of 60 to 70 cm, they were released from their cages and returned
              to the coral reefs (Faridah, 2019). Unfortunately, there's no
              recent data available on the current population of giant clams in
              the area. Our project began to address this crucial knowledge gap
              by conducting new research and observations to confirm the status
              of existing clam populations.

              Reef Check Malaysia has been annually reporting on reef conditions
              in several islands, including Tioman Island. However, the existing
              research methods rely on professional divers, volunteers, and
              government agencies. This approach not only poses risks but also
              lacks accurate imaging and detailed specifications of the clams.
              To overcome these challenges, our project embraces cutting-edge
              technology, specifically Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) and
              Artificial Intelligence (AI). These high-tech tools equipped with
              high-resolution capabilities enable us to capture underwater
              images with ease. AI assists in the instant identification of clam
              species and sizes, revolutionizing our data collection methods.
